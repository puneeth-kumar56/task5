Sales Data Analysis with Pandas
This project demonstrates data analysis and visualization using Python with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. It covers data cleaning, grouping, aggregation, advanced analysis, visualizations, and exporting results. If a real sales CSV file is not provided, it generates realistic sample sales data for demonstration.

Features
Data Loading

Reads sales data from a CSV file.

Creates sample sales data if CSV is not available.

Data Analysis

Sales by category, region, and sales representatives.

Monthly sales trends.

Product performance with top-selling items.

Discount impact on sales.

Cross-analysis of category vs region.

Correlation analysis of numeric features.

Visualizations (Dashboard style)

Total sales by category (bar chart).

Sales by region (pie chart).

Monthly sales trend (line chart).

Sales representative performance (horizontal bar chart).

Price vs quantity scatter plot (colored by total sale).

Discount distribution (histogram).

Summary Report

Total revenue, total transactions, average sales value.

Best-performing category, region, and sales rep.

Month-over-month growth percentage.

Export Results

Exports analysis summaries as CSV files:

sales_analysis_summary.csv

category_analysis.csv

region_analysis.csv

sales_rep_performance.csv

Technologies Used
Python 3.8+

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sales-data-analysis.git
cd sales-data-analysis
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Example requirements.txt:

text
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
Usage
Run the analysis script:

bash
python sales_analysis.py
If you have a sales dataset, place it as sales_data.csv in the project folder.

Otherwise, the script will generate sample sales data automatically.

The script will:

Perform analysis and display results on the console.

Generate visualizations in a dashboard format.

Export CSV reports with summary insights.

Example Insights
Electronics is usually the top-performing category.

Certain regions contribute more strongly to revenue.

Large discounts do not always lead to higher sales revenue.

Seasonal patterns are visible in monthly sales trends.
